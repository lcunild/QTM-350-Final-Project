COVID19 will not be the last pandemic threat the world faces I spoke to the GrandChallenges community about the ambitious innovation agenda we need to end this crisis and be ready to respond to the next
Getting to zero carbon emissions isnt optional After COP26 I am optimistic that we can meet the challenge
Im proud that Breakthrough Energy is a part of the First Movers Coalition Our efforts with wef ClimateEnvoy and other partners will help to scale the clean technologies that will become the foundation of our netzero future
Demand for syringes has skyrocketed to deliver the COVID19 vaccines Increasing production of autodisable syringes will help ensure low and middleincome countries have the tools they need to deliver routine and COVID vaccines
Im grateful for the leadership of our Breakthrough Energy Catalyst public and private sector partners By taking coordinated courageous climate action we can lower Green Premiums and deploy the clean technologies that will help us reach net zero
Getting to zero emissions will be the hardest thing people have ever done This was a great conversation about the power of innovation and what the world can accomplish if we work together
I was truly inspired to hear Vinisha27738476 speak at COP26 this week Her optimism and passion for innovation makes me hopeful that we can avoid a climate disaster
Thank you SecGranholm for your leadership The commitment of ENERGY and the innovate spirit of our National Labs will drive the breakthroughs we need to help the whole world get to NetZero
Publicprivate collaborations will be critical to reducing emissions and achieving our 2050 climate goals Our work with MICleanEnergyRD will help us do just that
Im excited about Breakthrough Energys expanded work with MICleanEnergyRD Thank you JonathanWNV for your partnership

Weve done some important work since the Paris Agreement was signed six year ago but were still nowhere near where we need to be on climate Watch live from COP26 in Glasgow as I talk about the steps we can take to combat climate change
Five years ago the Paris Agreement went into effect Paris provided an important framework in the fight against climate change but it wasnt enough Thats why Ill be speaking in Glasgow on Monday about the road ahead and what young people in particular can do to help
Visit  to find your polling location And if you have any questions call the voter hotline at 8333368683
Today is Election Day and so much of what we care about is on the ballotfrom access to health care to bringing our economy back from COVID19 to combating climate change We need everybody going out to vote So make a plan to vote and make your voice heard
Signing the Paris Agreement to fight climate change was one of my proudest moments in office But it was always a foundation to build on As world leaders gather for COP26 I shared some reflections on the road to Paris and the young activists who are pushing us further
In a country as large and diverse as ours progress can often feel frustrating and slow with small victories accompanied by frequent setbacks But once in a while its still possible to take a giant leap forward Thats what the Build Back Better framework represents
Climate change isnt a distant environmental issueits already having an immediate impact on our lives including huge national security implications as more communities come under stress
When you look at the history of big social movements theyre usually started and sustained by young people who put in the work to make it happen As we look to COP26 Im inspired by the young people using their voices in the fight against climate change
