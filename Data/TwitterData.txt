Almost no one understands this.

Demand for syringes has skyrocketed to deliver the COVID-19 vaccines. Increasing production of auto-disable syringes will help ensure low- and middle-income countries have the tools they need to deliver routine and COVID vaccines. https://t.co/Acou25JVf5

We’ve done some important work since the Paris Agreement was signed six year ago, but we’re still nowhere near where we need to be on climate. Watch live from #COP26 in Glasgow as I talk about the steps we can take to combat climate change. https://t.co/fpoGbnNehm
Five years ago, the Paris Agreement went into effect. Paris provided an important framework in the fight against climate change, but it wasn’t enough. That’s why I’ll be speaking in Glasgow on Monday about the road ahead and what young people in particular can do to help. https://t.co/E7P3X6jtny

Today is Election Day, and so much of what we care about is on the ballot––from access to health care to bringing our economy back from COVID-19 to combating climate change. We need everybody going out to vote. So make a plan to vote, and make your voice heard.
Signing the Paris Agreement to fight climate change was one of my proudest moments in office. But it was always a foundation to build on. As world leaders gather for COP26, I shared some reflections on the road to Paris and the young activists who are pushing us further. https://t.co/EebSdTQ6QS
In a country as large and diverse as ours, progress can often feel frustrating and slow, with small victories accompanied by frequent setbacks. But once in a while, it’s still possible to take a giant leap forward. That’s what the Build Back Better framework represents. https://t.co/ouKhRRz6qP
Climate change isn’t a distant environmental issue—it’s already having an immediate impact on our lives, including huge national security implications as more communities come under stress.

https://t.co/wLnJgynwCs
When you look at the history of big social movements, they’re usually started and sustained by young people who put in the work to make it happen. As we look to COP26, I’m inspired by the young people using their voices in the fight against climate change. https://t.co/IBdciqn8ml
