# QTM-350-Final-Project
We want to use the Amazon Translate service and the Twitter API (application for use pending) to pull tweets in various languages including English. After that, we want to use the Translate service to translate the tweets into English (or from English into another language, then back to English) to determine how well the service handles slang and non-traditional language. For example, we want to see how Translate will handle a phrase such as “on fleek” or any other of a number of slang phrases. As the project progresses, we plan to increase the length of the text that we submit for translation to the Translate service, and see how it performs. We think there are two potential results from here; the service could perform worse, because there is more language and slang for it to become confused on, or the service could perform better, because there may be more context and surrounding words that help it determine the meaning of the slang.
